# Fill You in the Blank (Bangkok CSR Matching Project)

Welcome to the Fill You in the Blank (Bangkok CSR Matching Project), an open-source initiative aimed at connecting CSR activities with the policies of the Governor of Bangkok and the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals.

"Fill You in the Blank" is a project designed to facilitate communication and collaboration between policy drivers in Bangkok, including government agencies, private sector, and civil society organizations. The project recognizes the complexity of urban development and the diverse needs and interests of stakeholders in working together to achieve common goals. The project's motto, "Fill You in the Blank,” emphasizes the importance of reducing siloed actions and supporting collaborative efforts. To achieve this, Fill You in the Blank offers various platforms, including Discord communities, WikiBangkok, and a dedicated website. The website features government and CSR projects aligned with Bangkok policies and Sustainable Development Goals, making it easier for stakeholders to find and engage with relevant projects. One unique feature of Fill You in the Blank is the ranking system for Active Citizens, which acknowledges the competitive involvement of individuals in the project and encourages participation and collaboration among stakeholders. The ultimate goal of Fill You in the Blank is to create a more cohesive and collaborative urban development system in Bangkok by promoting shared communication and resources. The project aims to increase efficiency and effectiveness in achieving common goals, whether you are a policy driver in the public or private sector, or a member of a civil society organization. Fill You in the Blank welcomes your participation in making Bangkok a better place.
